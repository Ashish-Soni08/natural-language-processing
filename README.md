# Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Hands-on Coursework

This repository contains a comprehensive set of projects and tutorials from the **Uplimit NLP Course (March 2023)**. The curriculum covers the lifecycle of modern NLP, from foundational word embeddings to state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 🚀 Projects Overview

The repository is structured by weekly modules, each focusing on a core pillar of NLP:

### 🔹 Week 1: Word Embeddings & Vector Search
- **Word2Vec Exploration**: Hands-on experimentation with word embeddings using `spaCy`.
- **Faiss Integration**: Building an efficient similarity search index for word vectors.
- **Concepts**: Semantic similarity, analogies (King - Man + Woman = Queen), and high-dimensional vector space intuition.

### 🔹 Week 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Sequence Labeling**: Building a Named Entity Recognition model from scratch.
- **Data Pipelines**: Large-scale data loading and preprocessing for token-level classification.
- **Evaluation**: Implementing metrics for entity recognition performance.

### 🔹 Week 3: Semantic Retrieval & FAISS
- **Embedding-Based Retrieval**: Implementing dense retrieval systems for finding semantically similar text.
- **Project**: Duplicate question detection using the Quora Question Pairs dataset.
- **Advanced UI**: Visualizing high-dimensional sentence embeddings using UMAP.

### 🔹 Week 4: Tokenization, Text Generation & LLMs
- **Deep Dive into Tokenization**: Comparing various strategies including Whitespace, spaCy, BERT (WordPiece), and SentencePiece (BPE).
- **Text Generation**: Building and training models to generate coherent text (from basic memorizers to more advanced architectures).
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Leveraging `Cohere` and `GPT-3 (OpenAI)` for prompt engineering and specialized NLP tasks.
